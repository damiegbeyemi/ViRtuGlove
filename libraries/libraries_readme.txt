Please see included in this folder the following libraries that must be installed for development of the Arduino firmware:
 - Adafruit_Unified_Sensor - a library used by numerous Adafruit sensor breakout boards
 - Adafruit_L3GD20_U - a library that holds functions that make use of L3GD20 gyros simple
 
 These libraries can be added to the user's Documents/ Arduino/ libraries folder.
 Alternatively, one may add these libraries using the Arduino IDE's built-in Manage Libraries tool.
